Endless runners (or infinite runners) rose to popularity at the same time as smartphones and tablets. Although concepts in them can be traced back to platform games in arcades in the 1980s, the first widely acknowledged example of an endless runner was the 2009 blockbuster release Canabalt for smartphones.

Endless runners only need one button to play, which is normally a single jump button. The player can only move
forwards and has no control over the speed they are travelling at. The challenge is for the player to try to stay alive for as long as possible by jumping over <i>obstacles</i> and avoiding falling into traps. The game will get faster as the player progresses through the levels. Each level brings new challenges and the only way for the game to end is if the player dies.

Endless runners work well on smartphones and tablets because you can control the player by simply tapping on the screen at the right time.This makes the games easy to play on the go. Trying to reach a higher level and increase your score also makes them addictive experiences.
